Strapi Content Types Implementation Plan
After reviewing the project documentation, I've developed a comprehensive plan for setting up the Strapi content types based on the database schema defined in the architecture document. This will provide the foundation for the Pinnacle Auto Finance Dealer Portal.

Content Types Overview
We need to create the following content types in Strapi:

Users (extending Strapi's built-in user type)
Dealers
Dealer Staff
Credit Applications
Documents
Communications
Application History
Automation Jobs
Implementation Details
1. Users Content Type
We'll extend Strapi's built-in user type with additional fields:

Additional user profile information
2. Dealers Content Type

Mileage
VIN
Financial Data (JSON):
Selling Price

Taxes
Doc Fees
Title/Lien/Reg Fees
Total Cash Down

Submission Date (DateTime)
Last Processed Date (DateTime)
Processing Status (Enum: pending, processing, submitted, error)
Processing Notes (Text)
Relation to Documents (One-to-Many)
Relation to Communications (One-to-Many)
Relation to Application History (One-to-Many)
Relation to Automation Jobs (One-to-Many)
5. Documents Content Type
Fields:

Relation to Credit Application (Many-to-One)

Implementation Steps
Configure Database Connection:

Update Strapi's database configuration to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
Create Content Types:

Use Strapi Admin UI to create each content type with their respective fields
Define relationships between content types
Set up validation rules for each field
Configure Permissions:

Set up role-based permissions for each content type
Define access control for different user roles
Create API Endpoints:

Configure custom controllers and routes as needed
Implement business logic for complex operations
Test Content Types:

Create sample data to verify content types are working correctly
Test relationships between content types
Next Steps
To implement this plan, we'll need to:

Access the Strapi admin panel
Create each content type with their respective fields and relationships
Configure permissions for each role
Test the content types with sample data
Would you like me to proceed with implementing these content types in Strapi? If so, we'll need to toggle to Act mode so I can interact with the Strapi admin panel and create the content types.
